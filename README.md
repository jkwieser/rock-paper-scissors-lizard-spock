Write a game employing **classes** (optionally).
A random integer between 1 and 25 [1:25] is to be created.
The user is asked to guess the number via an adequate method call.

The user shall be prompted whether the chosen input was greater or less than the random number.
Also, the user is given 5 tries to *win* the game.
The game allows 5 *rounds* and communicates *victory* (you win) or *loss* (game over).

**Note**
You can solve the task in any way as long as you employ classes and stick to the above minimum criteria.
The operational logic ought to be concise, sparse and efficient.
Use *try except* to catch errors.
Keep the DRY principle *Don't Repeat Yourself* in mind!
Write *beautifully and legibly*!



## 1.2 Rock, paper, scissors  
Ask the user to Create a game class for this exercise.  
choose between *rock, paper or scissors* (r,p,s) via a method.  

Return whether the user won or lost.  
In the case of a draw return `DRAW`.  
Handle incorrect input gracefully with *try except* and prompt the user for correct input.  

The game should last for 3 rounds (best of three).
Keep count of the score during the game and return it to the user.
Include a *tiebreaker* for equal score scenarios.
This should prolong the game until a clear victor emerges.
  
**Note**
Write *beautifully and legibly*!
Keep it short simple!
Work with classes and methods.
DRY.  
Think about appropriate loops.

**Optional extra points (+3) **
Extend *Rock, paper, scissors* with *lizard, Spock*!
